# MEAN Stack Skeleton App

Based off the elegant "MEAN Stack Single Page Application Starter", by [Chris Sevilleja (sevilayha)](mailto:chris@scotch.io).

Skeleton MEAN app, useful as a starting point for your projects.

## Features
- Components-based architecture.
- Separation of dev files (/app folder) and production files (/public folder).
- [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) pre-configured.
- Code standards (via [CSSComb](http://csscomb.com/) and [JSCS](http://jscs.info/)) and linting (via [JSHint](http://jshint.com/)).
- Automated fixing of CSS and JS files, using Grunt.
- Automated concatenation of files from dev folder to production folder, making it easy to add new components without needing to call countless scripts.
- [Browsersync](http://www.browsersync.io/) to make development as seamless as possible.
- LibSass-based SASS compilation.
- [Bourbon](http://bourbon.io/) and [Neat](http://neat.bourbon.io/).
- SASS partials, with basic setup.

2. Install npm modules and bower dependencies: `npm install && bower install`
3. Start up the server: `node server.js`
4. View in browser at http://localhost:3002 (because of Browsersync)
